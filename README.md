# swagBots
Late May 2017, I figured out that theSkimm's referral system had a loophole. When people use your link to subscribe to theSkimm, theSkimm doesn't actually check that the emails are real with a confirmation email. This meant that I could write a bot to artificially put emails into theSkimm to game the system and get swag.
